# PreVBD Automated Forecasting Service

## Description
PreVBD Automated Forecasting Service is a web-based application designed to automate the collection, processing, and forecasting of climate and mosquito abundance data for public health decision-making. The service integrates climate data from external sources, merges it with local entomological datasets, and applies statistical models to predict mosquito population trends and associated health risks at the district level. Results are exported in CSV format and can be visualized or used for further analysis. This tool supports researchers and health officials in monitoring and responding to vector-borne disease risks.
